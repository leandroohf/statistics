User generated Contents UGC\n        \n    * The interviewer let him choose. He explain that for heavy contents we dont care to much how social (interviewer notes: \"he doesnt want to go social in prfessional contents, he wants to try somethings thathasnt done before\") is the services we are more interesting in the quality of the contents. because of that he decide to go with UGC and he pick up a service like Youtube that is the largest service of this type in terms of #users\n    \n1. He stated the mission (start defining his goal)\n    *  Statet core metrics (North star): He mention that he forgot the excatly youtibe mission but should be something around \"How to provide useful contents to keep users engaged\"\n    \n    * He state the metrics: \"How to we use social as a way to engage people with the contents on youtube\"\n    \n    * He said I personally use youtube for 3 reasons:\n        1. entreternaiment  => jimmy cammel\n        1. news update => during presendential race\n        1. learning +. whether or not is math, calculus, dancing, cooking and etc\n    * he asked himself: which one o this cases can increase the value (engagement of sellers) if there is a social asect with it\n    \n    * interviewer notes:: \"He forgot to state the struture of his answer , but he thoughs are clear enough. Also he checkin-in if the interviewer is still following. He hasnt lost the interviewer\"\n    \n    * While checked the interviewer, he mentio how this is sounding to you. The interviewer asked him question to clarify the understanding of seller? He replied that he was thinking of creators (market place prokect biased him)\n    \n    * he clarifies better. Tere 2 sides of youtube, creators and viewers , like in market pace buyers and sellers. He changed how to make viewer experience more easy engaged\n    \n    * he meantioned pareto and that there are a way more viewers than creators (interviewer: engagement lift which is the majority of the users)  (This should be a discussion of user segments or cases)\n    \n    * he so went ot be more especific. How can we make learning experinece on youtube more engagement. His justfocation is that learning inngroups can be more motivated and make easier to learn something knew\n    \n    * He was asked how to define sucess on this. But he start rephraming the quesion and think about the pain points/needs of the viewers  (Brainstorming ideas)\n        * The first point of improve is there are so many videos out there for a single topic. How the users can know which one is the best video? Most relevant to me? here is a better way to discover most relevant video of lagrange sereie\n        * 2nd point of improvements is watching a solo videos we do not have any feedback, if another person has a similar question or if someone raise a different question that we were not thinking about it. There is no such of experience on that. \n        \n        * 3rd point of improvement: If he started watching the video, I do not have any evidence of the outcome of the video , if that videos is going to work for me or not (ther is no video summary, descriptionor a better way)\n        \n        * 4th point of improvements there is no gamification. Like motivation for me keep going and watching the video \n\n    * he said If I have to prioritize in terms of which of the pain points happened more often and which one has the biggest gap (has an huge effort to implement it) and which one brings the most impact\n    \n    * he starting thinking in how the social feature can help on those pain points list\n        * the right contents he said that is ML problem how to build better algo. He doens see social bring value to this\n        * He mention live learning experience should be hard to implement \n        \n        * He is thinking in probably go with some gamification idea or how to use social to make sure the viewer qill reach the desired outcome \n        \n        * he move to this idea of treat/ provide a solution to the 3rd item. Someone trying to cook something\n            \n        * he mention as example, the tik tok dancing tutorial. Now everyone thinks they can do it. He showed excitment about that, while explaining that in the sun everyone is trying to the tutorial and sharing ith others with the original tutorial (haf screen) and his performancing (the other half screen). Demonstrate passion about what he does\n        \n    * He moved in designing the features byu enumerate possibles solutions \n    \n        * He prompt that the easiest solution should be make viewers share their learnings or output (cooking shoe him/her preparing the receipt for instance) \"\"hay share you success\". When you finish the video, show your testimonial, or do a post about the topic. This can help other to understand what you are going to accomplish because you can add a gallery on the bottom providing thos testmonials or viewers that share that actual cokked the recipe and successful they were\n        \n        * he mention how to make easier for viewers to share their progress while they are wtaching the video\n        \n        * A way to make easieir for viewer do hey this is my version of the Famous cooker video or may way to do the same thing. He provide that example: \"Hey this the way kento did this chicken teriak and made that too\"\n        \n        * He summarize that we already have some goods and easy to implement ideas, like:\n        \n            1. post,\n            1. share snapshot of the progress\n            1. re mix contents\n            \n        * he mention that the second options are not much compelling, but if he have 1 year he would go with the 3rd option, but if he has 5 months he would go eith the 2nd option\n        \n    * The interviewer asked how you would measure siccess on this product \n    \n        * he meniton he was thinking about the funnel: \n            1. how many get aware of the new feature\n            1. how many start using the features\n            1. How many finished the producing there remix version\n            1. As measure of video qa hoe many users watch at least 30 seconds of the video and etc\n            \n    * He was asked about if this approach can be scalable for other contents (can be applied oto ther contents)\n    \n        * he mention everything that is based on repeat a sequence of process like fixing a car, cooking, wood working can use this new feature.\n        * he also mention that the largets contents of youtibe is entertenament and this can be used to mmic comeon or character like they do on tiktok "
